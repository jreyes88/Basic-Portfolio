  <!-- About Me -->
  <p>I was born in San Antonio, but moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas. There I studied English and Philosophy (i.e., basically just wrote papers for about four years straight), proudly attaining my B.A. in 2010. My work experience includes document processing at <a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/">LegalZoom.com</a>, copy-edting for Badgerdog Literary Publishing, courier/administrative work at the <a href="http://ctr.utexas.edu/">Center for Transportation Research</a> at the University of Texas at Austin, and presently roasting coffee at <a href="http://www.progresscoffeeroasting.com/">Progress Coffee</a>.

  When I'm not coding, you can find me riding my bike around Austin, hiking and swimming in the Barton Creek Greenbelt, or out with friends playing pub trivia. some of my favorite things include: memes, and collaborative Spotify playlists. Favorite foods are pizza, cheeseburgers, and a big plate of migas. I even got this one place to make me a migas cheeseburger one time. D-e-c-a-d-e-n-t spells "Joey."

  Feel free to check out my digital portfolio or hop over to my contact page to send me an email!

  With love from Austin,
  Joey
